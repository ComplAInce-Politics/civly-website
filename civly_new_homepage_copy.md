## THE PROBLEM SECTION

**Headline:**
Traditional Opposition Research is Broken

**3-Column Layout:**

**Column 1: TOO SLOW**
Traditional firms take 3-4 weeks to deliver research. Your opponent isn't waiting. Critical intel arrives too late for debates, ads, and rapid response.

**Column 2: TOO EXPENSIVE**
$10,000 to $20,000 for a single opposition dossier. That's 5-10% of a down-ballot campaign budget - money that could go to voter contact and ads.

**Column 3: TOO DENSE**
100-page PDF reports that sit unread. When you need specific info for a press release or debate prep, you're searching through mountains of text.

## FINAL NOTE TO FOUNDERS

**This homepage focuses on ONE thing: Selling opposition research services.**

Not compliance. Not a platform. Not a suite of tools. Just one clear service with clear pricing.

**Why:**
- Prospects are asking for this
- You can deliver this TODAY
- It generates immediate revenue
- It's differentiated (faster + cheaper)

**Once you have 10 clients and $50K revenue, THEN decide:**
- Should we add compliance services?
- Should we build a platform?
- Should we add other features?

**But not before.**

**Right now: Sell one thing. Generate revenue. Prove the model.**
