## Action Plan to Fix Positioning

---

## CURRENT STATE (WHAT'S BROKEN)

### Homepage Problems:
- ❌ Headline: "AI-Driven Campaign Compliance Management"
- ❌ Focus: Compliance platform (nobody asking for this)
- ❌ CTA: "Request a Demo" (high friction)
- ❌ Positioning: SaaS platform (but prospects want services)
- ❌ No pricing visible
- ❌ Opposition research buried under "Solutions"

### Navigation Problems:
- ❌ Solutions → Compliance Engine (featured first)
- ❌ Solutions → Helios (buried second)
- ❌ No clear primary offering
- ❌ Confusing structure (what do you actually do?)

### Conversion Problems:
- ❌ No clear path to purchase
- ❌ No pricing information
- ❌ "Request a Demo" creates friction
- ❌ Prospects leave without understanding offering

---

## TARGET STATE (WHAT IT SHOULD BE)

### Homepage Fix:
- ✅ Headline: "Opposition Research in 48 Hours"
- ✅ Focus: Clear service offering
- ✅ CTA: "Order Research" (direct action)
- ✅ Positioning: Service business with AI advantage
- ✅ Pricing: $4,995 prominently displayed
- ✅ Opposition research is THE offering

### Navigation Fix:

### Conversion Fix:

**Decision Point:** What to do with compliance content?

**Option A: Delete Entirely** (Recommended)
- [ ] Remove compliance page

- [ ] Focus 100% on research

**Option B: Bury It**

**My Recommendation: Option A (Delete)**

## COMMON PUSHBACK & RESPONSES

**"But we built all this compliance stuff!"**
→ "Sunk cost fallacy. Market wants research, not compliance. Follow the signal."

**"Compliance is a bigger market!"**
→ "Maybe. But we can't build it with $0 revenue. Research gets us to revenue in 30 days."

**"We don't want to be a services company!"**
→ "Services fund the platform. Mailchimp, Basecamp, Wistia all started this way."

**"Can't we position both?"**
→ "Confused mind says no. Pick one, prove it, then expand. Otherwise we'll fail at both."

---
